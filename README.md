Codetective
=============
Sometimes we run into hashes and other artefacts and can't figure out where did they come from and how they were generated. This tool is able to recognise the output format of many different algorithms in many different possible encodings for analysis purposes. It also infers the levels of certainty for each finding based on traces of its representation .

This may be useful e.g. when you are testing systems from a security perspective and are able to grab a password file with hashed contents maybe from an exposed backup file or by dumping memory. This may also be useful as a part of a fingerprinting process or simply to verify valid implementations of different algorithms. You may also try running this tool against network traffic captures or large source code repositories to look out for interesting stuff.

You can either use a generic version or as a plugin for the Volatility framework. The usage is similar.

Changelog
--------
Version 0.9 by FyinG
--------
* Re-construct by Python3, fixed bugs

Version 0.8.2
--------
* Added detection for JWT tokens
* Added generic secrets detection

Version 0.8.1
--------
Finally a new version of Codetective is ready. This is close to a complete re-write with new features and many, many bug fixes. The code is still not something to look at but it’s now a lot more object oriented and easier to maintain. Now, codetective can also report the exact location of a finding and the ‘certainty’ feature is now numeric in order to include multiple factors with different weights and become more precise. The new entropy checks added to better detect cryptographic findings also take advantage of this and you can limit results being displayed only to findings with a specified minimum level of certainty (-m number).
A different approach regarding the way data is loaded into memory has been adopted so now Codetective will break data into slices and analyse them by turn. This is to prevent it from filling the memory when reading large files. To prevent losing results there is now an overlapping window which will make sure no findings are caught in the breaks (*). A verbose mode was also added, it’s now possible to see the progress status which can be useful for the longer runs.

Directory mode (-d rootPath) allows you to tell Codetective to look at folders rather than files and you can use it in recursive mode (-r) as well. if applied to large amounts of data, it might be useful to filter outputs by minimum certainty level e.g. -m 70. It also supports reading data from standard input.

A new filter was added called ‘personal’ and can be used for findings that may include personal data such as phone numbers and credit cards which are now supported as well. Other algorithms supported in the new version include web cookies, URLs and with the ‘generator’ option, Codetective will try to load all encoding/decoding supported by your Python environment (the ‘aliases’ module) and apply them in order to find something meaningful. This can be used to try multiple encoding (-g encode) or decodings (-g decode) or both (-g both). Preprocessors (-p) now allow binary structures to be first converted onto strings using the C struct packing string patterns. 
Finally, the ‘validators’ function now provides a powerful way to filter outputs. You may use up to 3 validators per run using the -v1 -v2 -v3 parameters respectively. Each validator it is a combination of a predicate ‘ALL’ or ‘HAS’ with a matching function such as UPPER for findings in upper case. Functions currently supported are :

* NUMERIC
* ALPHA
* LOWER
* UPPER
* ALPHANUMERIC
* SYMBOL

For a custom validator you can also provide your own regular expression using the predicate SEARCH followed by the desired regular expression.

(*) - you may have duplicate results because of this but will be addressed in future.

Supported filters are: win, web, unix, db, personal, crypto and other.

Discussion
----------

This script is heavily based on regular expressions done with a mindset of rejecting the maximum possible alternatives for each possible hash/code submitted but never to reject valid choices. Also, this code requires proper testing, so you're welcome to contribute with more algorithms and bring me the feedback.
Notice that this tool also infers on the confidence level relative to each guess and it's able to give you a preliminary analyze (-a). 

Notice that results improve with filters (-f) that can be specified so if you know that the source of the file is related to the web, Codetective will have more confidence when trying to determine the source of code when considering web applications frameworks such as Joomla or Django. 
If you find this tool useful, know that there is other called [Hash Identifier] (http://code.google.com/p/hash-identifier/)  that works in a different way that may also be helpful to you.

When using Codetective as plugin for Volatility remember to use uuids search option (-u) if you need it, since it is disabled by default. Most relevant options are -u (show UUIDs), -v (verbose mode), -t (filters), -p (search for Process ID) and -n (search for process name). If neither -p or -n is defined, if will search in all processes.

Finally, when passing strings from the command-line, always wrap your input string with '' (at least, if you're using bash) so that special characters such as '!' don't mess up with the input before it gets processed by Codetective.
